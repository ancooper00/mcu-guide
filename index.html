    <p class = "intro"> Entering the Marvel Cinematic Universe can be intimidating. Afterall there are
       20 movies with more on the way and 9 television series. On this website you will find a guide to almost
        everything Marvel Studios has made for their cinematic universe including full lists of the movies and tv shows as well as a list of my own top five favorite movies in the universe. </p>

    <p class = "intro"> Below you will find a list of the biggest part of the cinematic universe. It's the movies of course! Beside each movie poster will be a short description of the plot and how it fits into the larger universe as a whole. Below each description is my own personal rating of that movie. </p>

                <p>The movie that started it all. After a weapons demonstration in Iraq, billionaire and genius Tony Stark is captured by a terrorist organization. The capture also results in him having a chest filled with shrapnel. While held captive, he finds a way to miniaturize his arc reactor technology to power the magnet that keeps the shrapnel from getting to his heart. He also realizes that this power source could power somethings else, so with scraps he builds an iron suit to escape his captors.  Once home, he devotes his time to perfecting the Iron Man suit so he can protect mankind. His actions catch the attention of SHIELD, and introduce us to Nick Fury and the Avengers Initiative.</p>

This causes a rift between members of the team, especially Captain America and Iron Man. Cap believes that heroes should remain free as governments can be corrupted while Stark suprisingly sides with the government. The conflict is further complicated when it appears that the king of Wakanda has been killed by Cap's old friend Bucky. Captain America must work to protect his friend from Tony and a new threat that could tear the Avengers apart for good.  </p>
