<h2 class= "article"> A Guide to the TV Shows </h2>

   <p class = "article_intro"> 
Below you will find descriptions of the eight major shows that make up the small screen portion of the MCU. I am not super familiar with a majority of these shows because I have not had the time to invest in diving into their worlds, so the descriptions below will be pretty limited to just plot summaries for each show.  I am only familiar with the first few seasons of Agents of SHIELD and Agent Carter, so keep that in mind.
